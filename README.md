# Board-Game
A turn based board game based off the popular board game-Snakes and Ladders. Python was used to design and code this program from scratch. <br\>
The user can choose the size of grid (n x n) and the number of players who will be participating in the game as well. A random number generator of 1 to 6 is used to imitate a dice roll and a player landing on the location with a pre-existing player results in sending the pre-existing player back to the starting square.
